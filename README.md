# AIRBNB ANALYSIS

Persona: 

The user is an “Airbnb host” who plays a crucial role in the Airbnb ecosystem by renting their properties to guests looking for a place to stay.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS:

Q1. Which neighbourhoods are the most expensive to stay in and have similar rental prices, and what is the availability and range of room types in each neighbourhood?

Q2. Which neighbourhood had the highest number of reservations and reviews in the month with the most bookings, and what is the percentage of each neighbourhood group represented in that month?
